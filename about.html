    <p>Wallows is an American alternative rock band based in Los Angeles composed of Dylan Minnette, Braeden Lemasters, and Cole <br>
    Preston. The band began releasing songs independently in April 2017 starting with "Pleaser", which reached number two on the Spotify <br>
    Global Viral 50 chart. In 2018, they signed a record deal with Atlantic Records and released their major label debut extended play Spring.<br>
    Their debut studio album, Nothing Happens, was released in 2019 and included the single "Are You Bored Yet?". The band's three members—<br>
    Braeden Lemasters (guitar and vocals), Cole Preston (guitar and drums), Dylan Minnette (guitar and vocals), and formerly Zack Mendenhall <br>
    (bass guitar)— first formed a musical group as children in a music program: GigMasterz in Keyboard Galleria Music Center (Southern California), <br>
    they were called "Join the Band". Over the course of the next decade, the three performed together using different band names, such as The <br>
    Feaver and The Narwhals. The group changed their name one last time from The Narwhals to Wallows, as they wanted to go by a more professional <br>
    name. They also played the 2011 Warped Tour.<br><br>

    In April 2017, the band released their first single under the Wallows moniker, "Pleaser.” The song would eventually reach number two on the <br>
    Spotify Global Viral 50 chart and number one on the KROQ Locals Only playlist. In May 2017, Wallows released a second single, "Sun Tan", <br>
    and began playing live shows in the Los Angeles area, selling out The Roxy and the Troubadour. Their third single, "Uncomfortable", was released <br>
    in September 2017. <br><br>

    In November 2017, their song, "Pulling Leaves Off Trees", was premiered on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 radio show. That month, the band also announced <br>
    their first headlining North American tour that would run from January to March 2018. The tour started in San Francisco on January 24. In February 2018, <br>
    the band announced that they had signed to Atlantic Records and were planning to release their major label debut EP, Spring, in April 2018. They also <br>
    released a new single, "Pictures of Girls", their first on Atlantic.[16] The song was chosen as a "Critical Cut" by SiriusXM Alt Nation. <br><br>

    Wallows ended their North American tour at South by Southwest in March 2018.  Later in the month, they released a second track from Spring titled  <br>
    "These Days". The EP was released on April 6, 2018 by Atlantic Records and was produced by John Congleton. <br><br>

    On February 1, 2019, Wallows released the single "Are You Bored Yet?" featuring Clairo. This song is a part of their debut album, Nothing Happens, <br>
    released on March 22, 2019. A subsequent music video was also released on this day with a cameo of Noah Centineo and Kaitlyn Dever. <br><br>

    Wallows embarked on another leg of their Nothing Happens Tour in February 2020, a continuation of their 2019 Nothing Happens Tour, for 15 additional <br>
    stops. The band partnered with local, non-profit charities in each of the cities in this leg of the tour such as Project Lazarus and the LGBT Center of Raleigh. <br>
    Before each show, the band posted a list of donatable items for their attendees to bring (with the incentive of donating being a free Wallows pin) on their <br>
    social media accounts, and were able to garner a plethora of items to donate after each show In an interview with 97X, a Tampa radio station, Minnette <br>
    remarked that the nonprofit organization they partnered with in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Handy Inc., shared that Wallows fans had brought an equivalent <br>
    of five months worth of supplies to the band’s show.</p>
